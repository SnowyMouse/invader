  where to read script source data from.
- invader-recover: Added support for recovering hud_message_text tags.
- invader-string: Added support for making hud_message_text tags.

### Changed
- invader-build: The default script source location is now the data folder. Use

  will no longer try to save the scenario tag without script data.
- invader-string: Changed --format to --type

### Fixed
- Rewrote the script parser, improving accuracy and fixing a bug with desyncing
  on co-op on Halo: The Master Chief Collection.

## [0.49.1] - 2022-04-12
### Changed
- Added definitions for the April 2022 update of CEA.
- invader-extract: Rewrote the script decompiler. Scripts are now split on every
  256 KiB, a header is included in each script, and code output is more optimal.

- invader-extract: Fixed top-level begin blocks being added
- invader-recover: Fixed null terminator being included in recovered script hsc

### Changed
- invader-convert: Tag groups now have to be explicitly set with --groups rather
  than --type (sorry if some groups are really long; this is important though!)
- invader-edit: --set now takes more complex expressions, with "n" now taking
  the place of what "~" was. For example, --set "-2n+1" now multiplies the value
  by -2 and then adds 1. This is incompatible with older --set inputs, thus
  values for vectors must now be separated with commas instead of whitespace.
  For example, "-2,-5,2" instead of "-2 -5 2". Whitespace is ignored.
- invader-edit: --get on vectors are now comma-separated instead of with
  whitespace (due to the new expression parser)
- invader-edit-qt: Upgraded Qt5 to Qt6
- invader-edit-qt: Changed the audio backend to use SDL2
- invader-edit-qt: Holding shift when clicking "Open..." on a tag reference will
  now close the current window before opening the referenced tag

  `enable diffusion dithering` flag.
- invader-convert: Removed --all
- invader-convert: Removed --type (use --groups)
- invader-edit: Removed --fs-path
- invader-recover: Removed --fs-path

## [0.48.0] - 2022-03-13

- invader-script: Using "none" is now supported for tag paths. Note that this is
  not presently supported in any stock tools
- invader-strip: Readded --fs-path

### Changed
- invader-edit: Simple expressions are now supported in --set. Use `~+n` to add
  n to the value, `~-n` to subtract n from the value, `~*n` to multiply the
  value by n, `~/n` to divide the value by n, and `~` to not change the value.

### Fixed
- invader-bludgeon: A tag path OR --batch is now required
- invader-bludgeon: Fixed --batch narrowing searches instead of broadening them
- invader-bludgeon: Renamed --search to --batch

  -T internal_bitmaps, and -T internal_sounds_count which list all tags that are
  partially internal
- invader-strip: Added --search and --search-exclude

### Changed
- VT100 colors are now used on win32 builds. This may fix a few error messages
  being formatted/colored improperly as well as improve performance.
- "terminator" is no longer marked as invalid, thus icefields.scenario no longer
  needs bludgeoned
- Null terminated scripts are now allowed as official tools do this, thus
  various scenario tags no longer need bludgeoned
- Trigger volumes are better defined now.
- invader-archive: Verbose comparisons are now shown in an inverted tree, making
  it easier for collapsing in text editors
- invader-build: Reduced --extend-file-limits from 4 GiB to 2 GiB

- invader-info: Renamed a number of options to be consistent
- invader-strip: Clean tags are no longer stripped and are skipped instead

### Fixed
- Absolute paths or paths with '..' path components are now explicitly banned in
  tag paths (note: file paths may still use this). This fixes a vulnerability.
- invader-build: Fixed a number of scripting issues on MCC. This fixes an issue
  with the banshees not attacking the player on the level Halo.
- invader-build: Fixed cutscene title up time not being correct
- invader-build: Fixed recharge rate being set to infinite if a collision model
  has no recharge time set (it should be set to 1)

  a Custom Edition map

## [0.46.2] - 2022-02-07
### Added
- invader-bitmap: Added --allow-non-power-of-two

### Changed
- invader-edit: --set on a tag reference with an empty string will now clear the
  reference (it is equivalent to `--set ".group"` where "group" is the file
  extension of the current tag reference if --get was used)

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed issues with generating non-power-of-two DXT bitmaps
- invader-build: Now warns if using a non-power-of-two non-interface bitmap tag
  on MCC AND once again errors if on Xbox
- invader-build: Fixed Xbox maps not having the correct effect flag set, as the
  flags were changed between the Xbox Halo and Gearbox Halo PC releases
- invader-edit: Fixed allowing tag references that have a disallowed group (for
  example, referencing a light tag where a shader is expected)
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed issues with previewing non-power-of-two DXT bitmaps

## [0.46.1] - 2022-02-06
### Added
- invader-compare: Added --search and --search-exclude which allows you to
  include and exclude tags that match a given expression. You can use these
  individually or together, and excluding always takes precedence.

  match a given expression. You can use this with or without --search, and
  excluding always takes precedence.

### Changed
- invader-build: Now errors on invalid filthy part indices and warn if you try
  to use a filthy part index of 0 (since this gets defaulted)
- invader-build: Tags with CRC32 of 0xFFFFFFFF reported by the header no longer
  trip the checksum check. This warning is no longer a pedantic warning.

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed various scripting commands not working when using
  uppercase strings (uppercase strings are now currently only allowed for print
  commands)
- invader-compare: Fixed -t not being stackable

### Removed
- invader-compare: Removed --class (you can use --search instead e.g.
  `--search "*.biped"`) and  --exclude-class (use --search-exclude instead
  e.g. `--search-exclude "*.scenario_structure_bsp"`)

## [0.46.0] - 2022-01-31
### Changed
- Now uses the vorbisfile API to query sample count from Ogg Vorbis. This will
  drastically reduce invader-build's build time (+221% speed improvement on d40
  on an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 system running Arch Linux) and the time required for
  `invader-bludgeon -T invalid-sound-buffer`
- invader-compare: Differences with --verbose are now shown in more detail
- invader-compare: Added whitespace indenting to --verbose

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Color plates with a dimension larger than 32767 (INT16_MAX)
  will no longer be stored in a bitmap tag, as this produces a bitmap that is
  technically impossible to regenerate due to how the dimensions are stored
- invader-build: Fixed minimum velocity and potential and not being divided
  by tick rate
- invader-build: Fixed subpermutations not using the main permutation's gain
- invader-build: Fixed wind period in fog tags not defaulting to 1-1

- invader-build: Fixed particle radius animation not defaulting correctly
- invader-build: Fixed particle_system radius multiplier not defaulting in
  particle system states and particle system particle states

- invader-build: Fixed light volume frame exponents not being defaulted to 1
- invader-build: Fixed leaf maps and leaf map portals not being purged from
  scenario_structure_bsp tags
- invader-extract: Fixed minimum velocity and potential and not being multiplied
  by tick rate

## [0.45.1] - 2022-01-28
### Added

  to 0 to bypass this check
- invader-build: Now errors on mismatched collision models
- invader-script: Changed default node count (if -g is unspecified) to match
  CEA's node count

### Fixed
- invader-archive: Fixed Windows path separators being used instead of portable
  UNIX path separators when making .7z files
- invader-bludgeon: Fixed invader-bludgeon reporting it "Bludgeoned" tags even
  when no fixes were requested (and thus it did not change anything)
- invader-build: Fixed incorrect animation index being stored when merging
  child scenarios in command lists
- invader-build: Fixed player starting locations being merged when merging
  scenarios (this is actually not supposed to happen and broke c40!)
- invader-build: Fixed pathfinding surfaces not being generated for BSP tags
  that are missing them due to no baked lightmaps (which caused a crash in the
  original game)

## [0.45.0] - 2022-01-25
### Added
- New tool: invader-script - Compiles scripts
- invader: Added support for the MCC: CEA map format
- invader-archive: Added `--verbose` which will print whether or not a tag was
  omitted as well as doing verbose comparisons.
- invader-bitmap: Added `auto` to `--format` which will default to the smallest,
  lossless output (i.e. monochrome if input is monochrome, 16-bit if it fits in
  a 16-bit color space, 32-bit otherwise)
- invader-bitmap: Added `--reg-point-hack` which sets the
  `filthy sprite bug fix` flag
- invader-bitmap: Added `--alpha-bias` which sets alpha bias
- invader-build: Added `mcc-cea` as a build target
- invader-build: Added `--resource-path` which can specify a different path to
  load resource maps from

  assets should be used
- invader-edit: Added `--no-safeguards` which allows writing read-only data
- invader-edit: Added `--verify-checksum` which prints "matched" if the checksum
  in the header is correct or "mismatched" if not
- invader-edit: Added `--checksum` which calculates the checksum of the tag and
  prints it
- invader-edit-qt: Added viewing color plates in the bitmap previewer
- invader-info: Added `tag_order_match` which checks if a map has the same tag
  order as stock and, if not, whether it may (probably) be network compatible

### Changed
- invader: Definitions were updated to support MCC CEA season 8
- invader-archive: Tags that are excluded are now printed
- invader-bitmap: Changed the default format to `auto`
- invader-bitmap: If usage is set to alpha blend, bitmaps are now cropped if an
  edge has zero alpha and a warning will be displayed. If the resulting bitmap
  is non-power-of-two, then it will fail to generate a bitmap tag (unless the
  bitmap type is interface or sprites)
- invader-bitmap: Changed A8 to alpha-on-white instead of alpha-on-black to
  match the rendering output of the game
- invader-bitmap: Improved sprite generation to better match tool.exe (while
  still allowing sprites that exceed the limit with padding enabled but meet it
  with padding disabled)
- invader-build: `--auto-forge-target` no longer takes a parameter (it forges
  based on the input of `--game-engine`)
- invader-build: Scenarios with no scripts or globals now have their syntax and
  string data initialized
- invader-build: Changed `--build-version` to `--build-string`
- invader-build: Scripts are now compiled on build. Maps with scripts are now
  fully supported.
- invader-compare: Fixed `-p` still mismatching small discrepencies
- invader-edit-qt: Clicking "Find" and "Save As" for a tag now expands all
  directories to the tag's current directory
- invader-edit-qt: Changed listing mode to always be "fast" by default. This
  drastically improves performance on WSL
- invader-model: "Legacy" mode is now the only option as, while it's not very
  sane, the workflow of making a map currently fully depends on it. -L was also
  removed.
- invader-recover: Changed model recovery to follow the (formerly) legacy
  directory structure
- invader-recover: global_scripts are now extracted to the data folder root
- invader-sound: The default vorbis quality is now 0.8 and the default encoding
  is now 16-bit PCM.

- invader: Fixed a few fields in the actor tag not being shown in radians
- invader: Fixed an issue with symbolic links being followed through, resulting
  in errors
- invader: Fixed duplicate tags across multiple tags directories being
  considered in some programs
- invader: Fixed invalid enums not being properly detected if they're valid for
  HEK but marked as invalid for the game
- invader: Fixed iterating through directories with trailing slashes
- invader-archive: Fixed child scenarios not being included
- invader-archive: Fixed ignoring floating point numbers for mismatched values
- invader-archive: Fixed creating empty archives if all tags were excluded

- invader-build: Fix model size reading as 0 MiB when building Xbox maps
- invader-build: Fixed lighting issues for environment shaders on CEA maps
- invader-compare: Fixed precision checking ignoring floating point numbers
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed "forced shader permutation" and "hud text message"
  being defaulted to -1. It is no longer allowed to set these to -1, either, as
  they are known to cause unexpected crashes.
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed a crashing issue for fast loading mode if a directory
  was present on one tags directory but not the other (if multiple tags
  directories are used)
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed switching between monochrome and RGB bitmaps in the
  bitmap previewer breaking the colors menu
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed an out-of-bounds crash that occurs on newer Arch Linux
  installations (this issue always existed but was never caught until recently!)
- invader-model: Fixed "unnamed" not being renamed to "__unnamed". This probably
  did not do anything useful, but tool.exe does this, so we have to as well.
- invader-model: Fixed an incorrect region index being set for some models
- invader-model: Fixed triangles being corrupt for models with more than 65535
  vertices total
- invader-recover: Fixed alpha channel not being tagged correctly as an extra
  sample when making TIFFs

### Removed
- invader: Removed support for "custom_" prefixed resource maps
- invader: Removed all invader_ tag classes
- invader: Removed invader-compress
- invader: Removed support for compressed Gearbox maps
- invader-build: Removed `-a` (always index) and `-n` (no external assets) in
  favor of `-r` (use resource maps)
- invader-build: Removed `-u` (uncompressed) and `-c` (compressed)
- invader-build: Removed `-T` (tag space)
- invader-strip: Removed `-p` (preprocessing) since invader-compare has been
  able to do this anyway

## [0.44.0] - 2021-04-07
### Added
- invader-build: Added `-A` which specifies whether to forge/index against a
  specific target versus automatically doing it.
- invader-build: Added `-T` which can specify tag space
- invader-compare: Added `-j` which can let you specify the number of threads to
  do comparison. Note that doing this is a balancing act: more threads can help,
  but if I/O becomes the bottleneck (as is the case with many small tags), then
  more threads can also degrade performance. Smaller tagsets will not benefit
  from extra threads as much as larger tagsets, thus this setting is defaulted
  to 1 thread for the most consistent performance.
- invader-recover: Added `-O` to overwrite data rather than overwriting by
  default
- invader-refactor: Added `-R` which can replace strings in paths. For example,
  using `invader-refactor -R warthog puma -M move` replaces all instances of
  `warthog` with `puma`

### Changed
- invader: Re-enabled unused6, unused7, unused8, unused9 teams
- invader-build: Automatic forging and indexing now has to be manually invoked
  with `-A`
- invader-build: Unit HUD interface sequences are now checked
- invader-build: Using the high resolution scaling flag on Xbox is now treated
  as an error, as this functionality does not exist on the Xbox version
- invader-build: Some fatal errors have been reduced to errors since they are
  technically valid tag data and can be handled, but not valid for the target
  engine
- invader-build: Changed the valid parameters for `-g` to make it more
  consistent. All PC build targets are prefixed with `pc-`, and all Xbox build
  targets use the build version (i.e. `xbox-2276` for English, `xbox-0009` for
  Japanese, and `xbox-0135` for Taiwanese)
- invader-edit-qt: The tags directories are now listed in the title bar of the
  main window
- invader-edit-qt: Model node counts for the various LoDs are now hidden since
  these values are always overridden on build

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed an issue with -O resulting in Halo crashing
- invader-compare: Fixed a performance issue when comparing large tagsets
- invader-model: Fixed node list checksum not being copied
- invader-model: Fixed "base" permutation not being renamed to "__base"
- invader-model: Fixed marker, region, and node names not being lowercased
- invader-model: Fixed empty regions not being removed
- invader-model: Fixed some markers and triangles not being set to the correct
  region (or sometimes any region at all)
- invader-model: Fixed some triangles with -1 (null) as the shader not being set
  to shader #0, resulting in an error
- invader-model: Fixed regions starting with a tilde (~) not having the flag
  "cannot be chosen randomly" set
- invader-recover: Fixed node list checksum not being copied

### Removed
- invader-build: Dropped MCC build targets

## [0.43.0] - 2021-03-16
### Added
- New tool: invader-model - Compiles model tags
- New tool: invader-recover - Recover source data from bitmaps (if color plate
  data is present), models, string lists, tag collections, and scenario scripts
- invader-build: Added --stock-resource-bounds which, when building Custom
  Edition maps, only indexes a tag if the tag's index in the resource mapis the
  same on the equivalent stock resource map
- invader-edit: Added --list-values
- invader-resource: Added --concatenate which can concatenate an existing
  resource map's data

### Changed
- invader: Now uses long distance matching for Zstandard. This slightly improves
  compression ratio.
- invader-build: Changed --build-version's shorthand letter to `-B`
- invader-edit: Changed --list to instead show the entire structure in a TREE /F
  style. Note that this requires the terminal to support UTF-8.
- invader-edit: Changed --list to use -l (lowercase L) instead of -L which is
  used by --list-values
- invader-edit: Angles are now automatically converted to and from degrees.

### Fixed
- invader: Fixed alphabetical order for shader_transparent_chicago(_extended)
  tags
- invader-build: Fixed not defaulting pathfinding spheres for vehicles
- invader-build: Fixed `-w` not erroring if the index file couldn't be opened
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed tag subwindows (e.g. Preview bitmap") not being brought
  to front if they were already open
- invader-resource: Fixed defaulting to bitmaps and made specifying the type
  actually required.

### Removed
- invader: Removed the spheroid definitions as well as support for extracting
  and building maps with spheroid tags.

### Removed
- invader-resource: Removed --padding. Use --concatenate instead.

## [0.42.2] - 2021-02-10
### Fixed
- invader-edit: Fixed --list not working with arrays

## [0.42.1] - 2021-02-10
### Added
- invader-edit: Added --save-as (-O) which uses a tag path, where --output (-o)
  now uses a file path

### Fixed
- invader: Readded --fs-path. Oops.

## [0.42.0] - 2021-02-10
### Added
- New tool: invader-edit - Command-line tool for editing tags (primarily made
  for scripting)
- invader-compare: Added shorthand for the conversion types. g2m can be used in
  place of gbxmodel-to-model, m2g in place of model-to-gbxmodel, and x2c in
  place of chicago-extended-to-chicago

### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Optimized sprite placement if no budgeting is used
- invader-bitmap: Sprite sheets with multiple sprites in it now add margins to
  the sprites. We recognize that this is completely and utterly stupid due to
  how unreliable it is, but not having it breaks stock tags.
- invader-build: Bitmaps are now checked if they are supported by the target
  engine
- invader-collection: Changed input format from .tag_indices to .txt
- invader-edit-qt: Sprite count is now shown when viewing sprite sequences
- invader-edit-qt: Sprite size is now shown when viewing sprites
- invader-extract: Now uses the map type in the scenario tag for determining if
  a map is singleplayer, multiplayer, etc.

### Fixed
- invader: Fixed an exception error on some Windows shells
- invader: Fixed an issue with `-P` not working with multiple tags directories
  for tools with this option
- invader: Fixed compressed demo maps not working
- invader-bitmap: Fixed size being inaccurate in output
- invader-bitmap: Fixed sprites with double multiply usage having black borders
- invader-bitmap: Fixed regeneration error implying a bitmap tag exists if one
  does not
- invader-build: Fixed file size not being saved in the header
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed "Copy virtual path" not appearing for directories
- invader-info: Extended dirty check to check file size and type mismatching

## [0.41.4] - 2021-01-24
### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed single sprites sometimes resulting in too large of page
  sizes
- invader-bitmap: Fixed bitmap tags with multiple bitmaps breaking
- invader-sound: Fixed popping in split Xbox ADPCM sounds

## [0.41.3] - 2021-01-24
### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed sprite generation failing if no mipmap count is set
- invader-bitmap: Fixed sprite generation resulting in large sprites

## [0.41.2] - 2021-01-24
### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed an issue where some sprites would have a black border
- invader-bitmap: Fixed compressed flag not being set for DXT5 bitmaps
- invader-bitmap: Fixed encoding A8 - bitmap should be all black, not all white
- invader-build: Fixed defaulting map u/v scaling for shader_transparent_generic
  and shader_transparent_chicago maps
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed tag_collection tags not being editable if fast listing
  mode is on
- invader-edit-qt: Disabled Insert New if there are no items in an array (fixes
  a crash)
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed A8 bitmaps being displayed as an alpha blend of white
  instead of black

## [0.41.1] - 2021-01-20
### Fixed
- invader-convert: Fixed missing parameters in `-h`

## [0.41.0] - 2021-01-16
### Added
- New tool: invader-convert - Converts between various tag types (gbxmodel to
  model, model to gbxmodel, shader_transparent_chicago_extended to
  shader_transparent_chicago)
- invader-archive: Added `-e` and `-E` which check if a tag exists in a
  a specified directory (multiple directories can be specified). Using `-E`
  instead of `-e` does a functional comparison, too.
- invader-archive: Added `-O` to overwrite existing tags if `--copy` is used
- invader-build: Added `-g mcc-retail` which targets retail MCC (intended for
  CEA).
- invader-build: Added `-g xbox-tw` and `-g xbox-jp` which targets the Taiwanese
  and Japanese versions, respectively. These have a slightly higher tag space
  than the original English version and use a different build string by default.
  They also use fewer hardcoded strings.
- invader-edit-qt: Added `-L` which lets you specify `recursive` or `fast` list
  modes. Recursive listing is the old behavior which recursively scans all tags
  directories for tags, while fast listing results in the tag tree only listing
  tags when a directory is opened. The default setting is `recursive` unless you
  are on win32, which then it is `fast`. Also, filtering is only enabled while
  recursive listing is enabled.
- invader-edit-qt: Added alpha support to DXT1 decoding

### Changed
- invader: Switched DXT compression/decompression to libsquish. DXTn quality
  should be a bit better now!
- invader-build: `-E` now bumps the maximum file size of Xbox maps to 4 GiB.
  Take care that if your version of the game does not support your map's file
  size, it will crash if you try to load it.
- invader-build: Invalid text indices for item pickups and unit names/seats are
  now checked and reported as an error if invalid.
- invader-build: Using `-g mcc-retail` or `-g mcc-custom` targets 31 MiB of tag
  space
- invader-edit-qt: Optimized filtering a bit

### Fixed
- invader-archived: Fixed a segmentation fault when passing either `-g retail`
  or `-g demo`

## [0.40.1] - 2020-12-31
### Added
- invader-build: Added support for `uses demo ui`

### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Uses a new compression library for DXT compression, which adds
  color key transparency for DXT1 bitmaps
- invader-extract: Now generates mipmaps for dropped mipmaps from Xbox-extracted
  DXTn bitmap tags

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed sub-4x4 mipmaps not being generated
- invader-build: Fixed sawtooth count (affects the strobing effect of the doors
in the levels "Truth and Reconciliation" and "Keyes")

### Removed
- invader-bitmap: Removed dithering for DXTn bitmaps (the compression library
  doesn't support it sadly!)

## [0.40.0] - 2020-12-31
### Added
- invader-archive: Added `-g` to specify game target (now required if not
  archiving single tags)
- invader-build: Added `-g xbox` engine target
- invader-build: Added `-E` to use the maximum theoretical size for the given
  cache file (4 GiB for PC, 278 MiB for Xbox due to cache partition sizes).
  Doing so may result in the cache file requiring a mod to be loaded.
- invader-build: Added `-b` to set the build version (used for Xbox maps).
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-j` for specifying thread count when using `--all`.
  On an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 with a tags directory of over 10000 tags, this reduced
  the bludgeon time from 29 seconds to 4 seconds, making it over 7x faster.
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T invalid-uppercase-references` which detects and
  lowercases all references that contain uppercase characters
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T excessive-script-nodes` which detects and removes
  script node tables that exceed 19001 (tags that do this potentially crash
  stock Halo PC)
- invader-extract: Added support for 3D and cube map Xbox bitmap tag extraction
- invader-index: Added feedback for if the command was successful
- invader-resource: Added feedback for if the command was successful

### Changed
- invader: Fixed segfault when querying dependencies for various tools
- invader-archive: Error checking is now (mostly) disabled when archiving a map
- invader-bitmap: Dithering can now be used on regular bitmap tags, and so can
  sprite budgets above 512x512, but you will be warned that they will not save.
- invader-build: Font tags with alternative styles references will no longer be
  indexed
- invader-build: CRC32s must now start with `0x`
- invader-build: All errors with tag data are reported as fatal errors now
- invader-build: All stock HEK limits are checked when building for all PC
  versions of Halo
- invader-build: All original file size limits are now checked when building for
  all PC versions of Halo (except MCC). Use `-E` to use the old behavior's
  higher limits.
- invader-compress: Changed compression level minimum to 0. On Deflate, this
  effectively stores the original data uncompressed and simply adds a zlib
  header, so it will always be larger than the original size, but it's nearly
  instant.
- invader-info: CRC32s are now output starting with `0x`
- invader-sound: Now uses CPU thread count by default instead of 1

### Fixed
- invader: Removed the upper bound from heat loss per second in weapon triggers;
  this will allow weapons that take less than a second to cool down to build
- invader: Fixed error reporting not checking the result on ioctl on Linux-based
  operating systems (this resulted in the line length being undefined if it
  failed)
- invader: Dropped support for uncompressed Xbox maps
- invader-bitmap: Fixed the sharpening filter being twice as powerful
- invader-bitmap: Fixed blurring being slightly more powerful than it should be
- invader-archive: Fixed errors regarding maps not being able to be read when
  not using single tag archival
- invader-build: Fixed `-n` not working as expected
- invader-build: Fixed word wrapping using the wrong length
- invader-build: Fixed manually specified BSPs for command lists and encounters
  being warned as BSP #65535 if they are completely outside of the BSP
- invader-build: Fixed warning on command lists that have zero points being
  outside of the BSP
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed subwindows always being above of the main window
- invader-info: Fixed `-h` not listing every option correctly

### Removed
- invader-bitmap: Removed `-x`
- invader-sound: Removed `-x`

## [0.39.0] - 2020-12-07
### Added
- invader-build: Added `-g mcc-custom` which builds a Custom Edition map but
  compressed and indexed for MCC while generating a .fmeta file alongside it
- invader-refactor: Added --unsafe (-U) which can be used to do a no-move
  refactor where the destination tags do not exist. This does not affect class
  refactoring.

### Changed
- invader-build: Script node count is now limited to 19001
- invader-compare: Reverted the fix from 0.38.1 because it actually broke things
- invader-edit-qt: Surface indices are now marked as `cache_only` (hidden) for
  move positions since these are calculated at build time
- invader-refactor: The destination tags must exist (unless you use --unsafe)
  when doing a no-move refactor.

### Fixed
- invader: Fixed treating Latin-1 characters as protected
- invader-build: Fixed allowing null scenario palettes (this actually crashes
  Halo!)
- invader-build: Fixed an ellipsis when too many squad positions are shown that
  aren't in the BSP
- invader-build: Fixed an issue where the wrong death animation would play
- invader-build: Fixed move positions' cluster and surface indices not being
  calculated for squads
- invader-build: Fixed some hidden values not being calculated for machines
- invader-build: Fixed the pelvis node index not being calculated for bipeds;
  this only affected biped tags which `bip01 pelvis` was not the first node, so
  stock bipeds were largely unaffected
- invader-build: Fixed a hidden value not being calculated for actor tags
- invader-build: Fixed a hidden value not being calculated for
  detail_object_collection tags
- invader-edit-qt: Leading width is now automatically calculated when previewing
  font tags
- invader-sound: Fixed "Processing sounds" hang on some systems

### Removed
- invader-build: Removed `-d` as it isn't necessary, and it produces invalid
  files anyway

## [0.38.1] - 2020-10-27
### Changed
- invader-build: Now deswizzles Xbox bitmaps on build
- invader-build: The "leading width" value in font tags can no longer be set
  manually; it is set to (ascending height + descending_height) / 5 to be in
  line with what tool.exe does
- invader-build: More defaults are now set
- invader-build: Now detects if falloff distance is greater than or equal to
  cutoff distance and both are non-zero (if so, they get set to 0 and a warning
  is shown)
- invader-edit-qt: The relative file path is now shown in the title bar rather
  than the virtual tag path
- invader-sound: No longer sets values that are defaulted when building into a
  cache file

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed setting "zero gain modifier" to 1 on sound classes that
  default it to 0
- invader-compare: Functional comparisons now match empty tag references

### Removed
- invader: Removed "use xbox multipurpose channel order" from definitions
- invader-edit-qt: Removed editing "leading width" for font tags since this
  value gets overwritten anyway
- invader-extract: Removed deswizzling Xbox bitmaps on extraction

## [0.38.0] - 2020-10-19
### Added
- invader-archive: Added `-C` which copies the tags to a directory instead of
  creating an archive.
- invader-bitmap: Added `-R` which uses the compressed color plate data of the
  tag in place of an image file (this will not work with extracted tags)
- invader-sound: Added `--threads` or `-j` which can be used to parallelize
  encoding and resampling of sounds with a set number of threads. This can
  drastically speed up sound tag generation when creating a sound tag with
  multiple or split permutations.

### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Height maps have been capped to 0.5 height
- invader-bitmap: Generating a height map with 0 or less height no longer
  generates a height map, and an error will be printed to the console
- invader-bitmap: If a color plate has no bitmaps in it, then it is now an error
- invader-build: Having model, gbxmodel, or scenario_structure_bsp shaders be
  set to null now fails to build, as this crashes the game
- invader-edit-qt: Mousing over a tag now displays the file size and path of the
  tag

### Fixed
- invader-archive: Fixed .model references being converted to .gbxmodel when
  checking for dependencies
- invader-bitmap: Fixed spacing color only working if sequence separator is
  present
- invader-bitmap: Fixed generating too few mipmaps for non-1:1 bitmaps. This was
  unlikely to cause issues, since the mipmaps missing were all one-dimensional
- invader-bitmap: Fixed not setting "disable height map compression" by default
- invader-bitmap: Fixed `-P` not working with `-R`
- invader-bitmap: Fixed an issue with loading some bitmaps
- invader-build: Fixed some scenery spawns warning about fullbright when it is
  not an issue
- invader-build: Fixed checking for local nodes when a part did not, in fact,
  have them
- invader-build: Fixed warnings regarding weapon triggers showing the wrong
  trigger indices
- invader-dependency: Fixed .model references being converted to .gbxmodel when
  checking for dependencies

## [0.37.1] - 2020-09-15
### Added
- invader-bitmap: Added `light-map` as a usage
- invader-compare: Added `-G` which allows you to ignore resource maps for the
  current input
- invader-extract: Added `-G` which allows you to ignore resource maps

### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Lightmap bitmaps no longer generate mipmaps, as expected
- invader-info: Now reports if a map's tag indices are outside of stock Custom
  Edition's
- invader-info: Changed the outputs of some of the options given

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed mipmaps not generating

## [0.37.0] - 2020-09-10
### Added
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T invalid-strings`
- invader-compare: Added `--by-path` or `-B` which sets how paths are compared
  This can be useful for finding duplicate tags regardless of paths. You can use
  `-B any` to match any tags regardless of tag path (useful if inputs are
  different) or `-B different` to only match against tags with differing paths
  (useful if both inputs are the same)
- invader-edit-qt: Added a Goto menu to go to top level structs quickly
- invader-edit-qt: Added a color picker
- invader-edit-qt: Added an option to copy a virtual path without an extension
- invader-edit-qt: Added an option to copy a virtual path for a directory
- invader-refactor: Added `-M copy` which copies files without changing any
  references to the tags being copied *except* any references within the tags
  being copied

### Changed
- invader-bludgeon: Adjusted the threshold for nonnormal-vectors to trip. This
  will result in more problematic vectors being shown, but it may result in some
  vectors that are "normal enough" for tool.exe but not actually normal to show
  up, too.
- invader-build: Invalid vectors are now checked against and are considered
  errors if they are not normalized
- invader-build: String list strings that are empty or not null terminated are
  now errored (also applies to unicode string lists). This typically happens in
  tags that have been modified rather than generated.
- invader-build: Unicode string list strings that have an odd number of bytes
  are now errored
- invader-build: String lists that contain non-CRLF line endings (i.e. single \n
  or \r line endings) now result in an error. This typically only occurs in
  string lists that have been modified rather than generated.
- invader-edit-qt: Typing in a valid path with an extension into a dependency
  field will now change the class; this also applies to pasting in paths
- invader-edit-qt: A number of unused or invalid flags and enumerators have been
  hidden
- invader-edit-qt: Alphas for colors are no longer previewed by default for
  anything
- invader-refactor: Moved `--move` and `--no-move` to `-M` which is now `--mode`
- invader-string: If the `###END-STRING###` line is missing, Invader will error.
- invader-string: The format is now automatically determined by checking if the
  tag exists.

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed not taking rotation into consideration when checking if
  an object is in the BSP or not
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed an issue with editing ColorARGBInt values
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed an issue with names missing in arrays
- invader-info: Fixed opening protected maps resulting in an exception error

### Removed
- invader-edit-qt: Removed "mcc actor type"

## [0.36.1] - 2020-07-22
### Changed
- invader: Renamed extended_bitmap to invader_bitmap and extended_sound to
  invader_sound. The bitmap tags can simply be renamed. The sound tags can be
  renamed if they were made in 0.36.0 or newer; otherwise they have to be remade
  (as usual).

### Fixed
- invader: Fixed superclasses (e.g. object) being directly supported as
  references, since these tags do not actually exist as real tags
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed an issue where clicking "Cancel" when prompted whether
  you want to save in the tag root would still result in saving

## [0.36.0] - 2020-07-22
### Added
- invader-build: Added warnings for if you use multiple variants for a slot in a
  conversation
- invader-edit-qt: Added filtering in the Find dialog
- invader-edit-qt: Made the filter in the Find dialog and the path in the Save
  dialog have focus
- invader-edit-qt: Added selecting individual pitch ranges
- invader-sound: Added `-b` for constant bitrate for Ogg Vorbis (extended_sound
  tags will have to be remade - sorry!)

### Changed
- invader: Decompressing vertices now clears the "zoner" and "uses local nodes"
  flags since compressed vertices do not use these
- invader-bitmap: Improved the accuracy of checking bitmap tags against the
  tags in the bitmaps.map file when compiling Halo Custom Edition maps. Sprites,
  sequences, resolution, data format, type, and mipmap count are all checked.
- invader-sound: Improved the accuracy of checking sound tags against the sound
  tags in the sounds.map file when compiling Halo Custom Edition maps. Sample
  rate, channel count, format, pitch range pitches, pitch range actual
  permutation count, permutation indices, permutation gains, and skip fractions
  are now all checked.

### Fixed
- invader: Fixed decompressing vertices not calculating weight correctly
- invader: Fixed compressing vertices using local node indices instead of actual
  indices (this affects Xbox map compilation support, mainly, which isn't yet
  implemented)
- invader-build: Fixed an issue where participants were set as valid when they
  shouldn't have (fixes unused dialogue being played in maps like b30 and a50)
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed a crash issue with Point2DInt
- invader-extract: Fixed sounds from sounds.map being extracted with the wrong
  sample rate

## [0.35.1] - 2020-07-18
### Added
- invader: Re-added checking and erroring on invalid command list indices
- invader-refactor: Added class refactoring
- invader-resource: Added `-M` which allows you to specify cache files to create
  resources

### Changed
- invader: Added support for the missing tags: continuous_damage_effect,
  multiplayer_scenario_description, preferences_network_game, and spheroid
- invader-build: Implemented "blend shared normals"
- invader-edit-qt: Monochrome bitmaps now show "Alpha-Luminance", "Luminance
  only" and "Alpha only" instead of individual color channels, since those would
  be meaningless

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed an issue with the intensity of pixels being off-by-1 for
  truly monochromatic inputs
- invader-build: Fixed the maximum distance value not being set correctly for
  sound_looping tags that have detail sounds
- invader-build: Fixed `-u` and `-c` being ignored if specified before `-g`
- invader-compare: Fixed `-f` requiring a tag input
- invader-compare: Fixed mismatched tags showing up twice
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed "damage upper bound" showing as two separate fields
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed 2D and 3D Euler angles not showing up as degrees
- invader-refactor: Fixed `-M` not working

## [0.35.0] - 2020-07-14
### Added
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T nonnormal-vectors` which can detect and fix
  potential vectors that tool.exe does not like when building lightmaps
- invader-build: Added word wrapping for most error messages when on Linux or
  Windows
- invader-build: Added some minor warnings for weapons
- invader-compare: Added `-f` which will check if tags are functionally
  identical by compiling the tag beforehand (this will be slower)
- invader-edit-qt: Added an error message for if a subdirectory could not be
  queried
- invader-edit-qt: Added a filter option in the View menu to filter out tags
  that don't match a given expression
- invader-edit-qt: Added support for model tags (as opposed to gbxmodel)
- invader-edit-qt: Added support for hexadecimal input (integers only)
- invader-edit-qt: Added comments for some fields in weapons.
- invader-edit-qt: Added an icon courtesy of ST34MF0X
- invader-extract: Xbox model tags now extract
- invader-extract: Added word wrapping for most error messages when on Linux or
  Windows
- invader-font: Added `-l` to limit to the first 256 characters
- invader-resource: Added `-p` to specify a number of extra bytes to add after
  the header when generating resource maps
- invader-resource: Added `-w` to specify resource indices rather than the
  default Custom Edition resource indices

### Changed
- invader: Help menus will adapt to the user's terminal width if the user is on
  either Linux or Windows and their terminal width is at least 80 characters
- invader: "dark" and "Dark Circlet" have been renamed to "native" and
  "Invader (native)", respectively
- invader: Invalid indices in command lists are no longer considered an error,
  as "fixing" them can result in unintended consequences on some campaign maps
- invader: Maps will no longer load if they contain invalid paths
- invader-build: Now warns if scenery and light fixtures were found outside of
  the BSP, as they won't spawn if they were
- invader-build: Maps that error due to multiple objects sharing the same name
  now list the objects with the name to help you track them down
- invader-build: Non-power-of-two bitmaps now result in a pedantic warning
  instead of an error
- invader-build: Now looks for custom_bitmaps.map, custom_sounds.map, and
  custom_loc.map and uses those if present when building Custom Edition maps
- invader-build: The final CRC32 now factors in bitmap/sound data (unless you
  decide to forge the CRC32)
- invader-build: The commit hash is no longer included in cache files due to low
  space
- invader-build: If building a Halo Custom Edition map and tags are detected to
  not match a tag found in a resource map with the same path, then a minor
  warning will be emitted (does not apply if using `-a` or `-n`)
- invader-build: Now warns if shader_transparent_generic tags are used upon
  building for the Gearbox port
- invader-build: Elements in weapon HUD interfaces now set the zoom bit even if
  no crosshair in the tag is a zoom crosshair and it uses one of the three zoom
  flags (the respective warning is removed)
- invader-compare: Using `-s matched` or `-s mismatched` no longer prints the
  `Matched: ` or `Mismatched: ` prefixes, nor does it show the count matched or
  mismatched. This should make it useful for piping to a program or text file.

- invader-edit-qt: Null indices now have placeholder text, and null indices can
  be empty

- invader-resource: Replace `-R` with `-g` which is now required
- invader-resource: Custom Edition maps are now prefixed with "custom_" by
  default for the purpose of extracting both Custom Edition and retail Halo PC
  maps w/in the same maps directory; use `-n` to disable this behavior
- invader-resource: Building loc files with an index no longer requires an
  explicit extension in the index, and if one isn't present, then it will search
  for the tag to find the extension
- invader-string: Empty string list tags can no longer be created

### Fixed
- invader: Added an enum in the actor_variant tags for MCC's scoring
- invader: Fixed the ColorARGBInt definition (you do not need to re-extract tags
  or rebuild maps for this - it effectively only impacted invader-edit-qt)
- invader: Fixed a couple issues with compressed vertex generation, including an
  issue with null part indices as well as an issue with part indices exceeding
  42 (so if it exceeds 42, Invader will not attempt to generate compressed
  vertices)

  would result in Halo refusing to load the map.
- invader-bitmap: Fixed an issue with DXT3 making some fully opaque bitmaps
  semi-transparent
- invader-bludgeon: Fixed an issue where it would warn about model nodes missing
  compressed vertices if a part node exceeds 42 (it is impossible to compress
  vertices with more than 42 parts)
- invader-bludgeon: Fixed printing "no issues detected" after printing issues
  that were detected
- invader-build: Fixed an issue where filthy parts were not saved, resulting in
  the FP needler core not glowing (you will need to re-extract any GBXModel tags
  that were affected by this issue)

- invader-build: Fixed bend bounds defaulting to 0-1 rather than being based on
  natural pitch (you will get a pedantic warning if it does this and your bend
  bounds are not 0)
- invader-build: Fixed decal radius upper bound not being defaulted correctly
- invader-build: Fixed damage effect maximum intensity and camera shaking wobble
  period not defaulting to 1
- invader-build: If a tag class is unimplemented, a more descriptive error is
  shown
- invader-build: Fixed a crash with some maps that have fog planes such as d40

  sounds.map, respectively
- invader-resource: Fixed building Custom Edition sounds.map files having
  partially cut off sounds in sounds with multiple permutations
- invader-sound: Fixed an issue with generating split sound tags not setting the
  actual permutation count correctly as a result of a past optimization

### Removed

  put in resource maps

## [0.32.5] - 2020-04-01
### Added
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T invalid-indices` which nulls various invalid
  indices. Note that this may result in various Bungie assets working slightly

### Changed
- invader-build: Now errors on more invalid indices

## [0.32.4] - 2020-03-31
### Changed
- invader: Dependencies with zero-length paths now get defaulted to the default

  scenario tags.
- invader-build: Added child scenario merging
- invader-edit-qt: Left-clicking an array name replaces the combo box with a
  spin box so you can type an index in directly

### Changed
- invader-build: Now checks extension separately from scenario name
- invader-build: Maps with script data can no longer be built without source
  data. This is due to the fact that such scenario tags are going to be broken.
- invader-build: Firing positions, squads, and command list points that fall out
  of BSPs are now listed
- invader-compress: `--level` now applies to MCC/Xbox
- invader-extract: Now always decompiles scripts
- invader-edit-qt: Invalid values are displayed as red, and missing dependencies
  are displayed as orange
- invader-index: Renamed invader-indexer to invader-index to be more in line
  with the naming scheme of Invader tools

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed the check for child scenarios; these still don't work
- invader-build: Fixed some command lists not working correctly due to the point
  surface indices not being calculated. This may not fix all of them, so stay
  tuned for more changes.
- invader-build: Greatly improved the accuracy of firing positions so everything
  (or nearly everything) firing position related works
- invader-build: Fixed some AI conversations not playing

  sound buffer sizes set in the tag (can fix instances of sounds being the
  incorrect length when played in-game)
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T missing-vertices` which fixes (un)compressed
  vertices being missing; not having these present in BSP tags can result in
  errors when performing lightmap generation
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T invalid-reference-classes` which nulls references
  with invalid references; more functionality is planned for this later
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T invalid-power-of-two` which marks non-power-of-two
  bitmaps as power-of-two and vice versa
- invader-bludgeon: Added `-T out-of-range` which clamps values that are outside
  of their respective ranges
- invader-build: Added a warning for using `-o` and outputting a map that does
  not match the scenario tag (unless building for MCC)

### Changed
- invader: Changed the internal Dark Circlet map format to use 64-bit offsets
- invader: Removed checking for invalid values when compiling a tag outside of
  invader-build (i.e. recursion in invader-dependency, invader-extract, etc.)
- invader-bitmap: extended_bitmap tags now store compressed color plate data in
  Zstandard

## [0.30.0] - 2020-03-15
### Added
- New tool: invader-bludgeon - Tool that convinces tags to work with Invader
- New class: extended_bitmap - Contains all extra features in invader-bitmap
  that are not present in stock tool.exe (use `-x` to enable)
- New class: extended_sound - Contains all extra features in invader-sound
  that are not present in stock tool.exe (use `-x` to enable)
- invader-edit-qt: Added two new buttons to arrays: "Insert" and "Delete All".
  "Insert" now does what "Add" did, and "Delete All" now does what "Clear" did.

  use this feature)
- invader-edit-qt: Added opening tags if a path is given when opening the
  program

  to extended_bitmap
- invader-edit-qt: Improved styling and UX
- invader-edit-qt: Bitfields can no longer be highlighted
- invader-edit-qt: Limits for certain tags are enforced
- invader-edit-qt: Some elements have been marked as read-only. This isn't as
  restrictive as Guerilla, but there are some elements that, if edited, will
  likely lead to the tag not working in invader-build or Halo. Use
  --no-safeguards to override.
- invader-edit-qt: The "Clear" button now clears all fields rather than deleting
  all elements from the array
- invader-edit-qt: The "Add" button now appends elements to the bottom of the
  array similar to what Guerilla does
- invader-edit-qt: Opening a file now displays in the status bar
- invader-sound: Specifying the format is now required whenever sound data is
  being put into a map
- invader-sound: Moved forcing sample rate and channel count to extended_sound,
  as well as using FLAC tags or creating sound tags without specifying a format

### Fixed
- invader: Fixed some issues with outputting text on various installations of
  Windows
- invader-build: MCC maps no longer include bitmap or sound data inside of the
  cache file since it isn't even used. This should make maps smaller.
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed a performance issue on Windows
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed out-of-bounds enums crashing. For tags that have
  invalid enums, you should use invader-bludgeon to resolve them.
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed closing modified tags crashing if "Save" was clicked
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed memory not being freed when closing a tag until
  another tag was opened
- invader-edit-qt: Fixed an issue where files >2 GiB would not open on Windows;
  this was due to filesystem::file_size() being bugged in the fs implementation

### Removed
- invader-bitmap: Removed dithering red, green, and blue channels individually.
  Instead, you use "a", "rgb", or "argb" for colors.

## [0.27.0] - 2020-02-24
### Added
- invader-info: Added `-T uncompressed-size`
- invader-build: Added `anniversary` as an engine target. If building MCC CEA
  maps, you will need to modify the .fmeta tag, too

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed maps with stubbed tags being detected as protected in
  invader-info; note, however, that maps will need to be rebuilt

## [0.26.1] - 2020-02-21
### Added
- invader-extract: Can now extract BSP tags from CEA maps.

## [0.26.0] - 2020-02-21
### Added
- invader-compress: Can now decompress/compress CEA maps. If decompressed by a
  tool besides invader-compress, then the engine version in the header will
  need to be changed from 0x7 (7) to 0x233 (563) to correctly recompress. The
  value will be set back to the correct value upon compression.
- invader-extract: Can now extract tags from CEA maps. If the map is
  uncompressed from a tool besides invader-compress, then the engine version in
  the header will need to be changed from 0x7 (7) to 0x233 (563) to correctly
  load. BSP tags, sounds, and bitmaps do not currently extract.
- invader-indexer: Can now index tags from CEA maps. If the map is
  uncompressed from a tool besides invader-compress, then the engine version in
  the header will need to be changed from 0x7 (7) to 0x233 (563) to correctly
  load.
- invader-info: Can now query CEA maps. If the map is uncompressed from a tool
  besides invader-compress, then the engine version in the header will need to
  be changed from 0x7 (7) to 0x233 (563) to correctly load.

## [0.25.2] - 2020-02-12
### Added
- invader-refactor: Added `-D` which performs the operation without making any
  actual changes
- invader-refactor: Added `-s` which only writes to a single tag

### Changed
- invader-build: Now errors if any tag has an animation graph but no model
- invader-refactor: Some exceptions are now handled by gracefully closing
  rather than calling abort() and crashing.

### Fixed

  (used in invader-build). This is to make tags easier to compare.

### Changed
- invader: gbxmodel tags that have markers located in the main model struct are
  now considered invalid
- invader: Tags with multiple consecutive path separators are now fixed when
  run through the tag or map parser

- invader-extract: Now recalculates detail node count on extraction
- invader-extract: Extracts markers in the reverse order that tool.exe adds
  them
- invader-extract: Removes the `blend_shared_normals` flag on extraction to
  prevent generational loss (since tool.exe may change the normals again!)
- invader-strip: Default values are no longer automatically set

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed "zoner" gbxmodel tags not having the correct detail node
  counts
- invader-extract: Fixed change color permutation weights being extracted
  incorrectly. **You will need to re-extract your tags!!!**

  difference in the standard library implementation.

## [0.23.0] - 2020-01-19
### Added
- New tool: invader-strip - Strips extra hidden data from tags.
- invader-build: Added a CRC32 check on tag load. This will drastically
  increase build time, but it will still be much faster than tool.exe. You can
  turn this off by turning off pedantic warnings (`-H`) or reset the CRC32 with
  invader-strip.

## [0.22.4] - 2020-01-17
### Added
- invader-info: Added `-T tags-external-bitmap-indices` which lists all bitmap
  tags in a Custom Edition map that use an external index
- invader-info: Added `-T tags-external-indices` which lists all tags in a
  Custom Edition map that use an external index
- invader-info: Added `-T tags-external-loc-indices` which lists all tags in a
  Custom Edition map that aren't sounds or bitmaps but use an external index
- invader-info: Added `-T tags-external-sound-indices` which lists all sound
  tags in a Custom Edition map that use an external index

### Changed

## [0.22.3] - 2020-01-15
### Added
- invader-build: Minor warnings are now considered "pedantic" and can be hidden
  with `-H`. You should probably still fix these warnings, as you may be
  getting an undesirable result.
- invader-build: Added warnings for non-power-of-two bitmaps being incorrectly
  set as power-of-two and vice versa.
- invader-build: Stock multiplayer maps for demo, retail, and Custom Edition
  are now automatically indexed to prevent crashing when joining with modified
  maps.
- invader-build: Stock multiplayer maps for Custom Edition now have their CRC32
  automatically forged to whatever the stock CRC32 is to allow users to join
  other servers with modified maps.
- Added library-wide Ogg Vorbis and FLAC decoding and encoding

- invader-build: If building a retail or `dark` map with a stock scenario name,
  the following values are set:
    - `vehicles\rwarthog\rwarthog_gun` autoaim angle: 1 degree (6 if `dark`)
    - `vehicles\rwarthog\rwarthog_gun` deviation angle: 1 degree (12 if `dark`)
    - `vehicles\banshee\banshee bolt` stun: 1
    - `vehicles\banshee\banshee bolt` max stun: 1
    - `vehicles\banshee\banshee bolt` stun time: 0.15
    - `vehicles\ghost\ghost bolt` stun: 1
    - `vehicles\ghost\ghost bolt` max stun: 1
    - `vehicles\ghost\ghost bolt` stun time: 0.15
- invader-build: If a value is changed automatically due to the map being a
  singleplayer or stock map, a warning is now displayed.

- invader-extract: Fixed converting degrees to radians with the lens_flare
  rotation scale

## [0.21.2] - 2019-12-26
### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed an issue with some old device_light_fixture tags being
  treated as device_control tags. This generally did not result in gameplay
  issues, but it may have resulted in a prompt to "activate" it when the player
  was close to the object.

## [0.21.1] - 2019-12-25
### Added
- invader-sound: Added `--channel-count` to allow you to specify the channel

  uses external pointers (sometimes occurs if built from tool.exe due to a bug
  with indexing raw data)
- invader-info: Added `-T tags-external-pointers` which list tags that have
  external pointers that were not indexed

### Changed
- invader-info: Now outputs some details in color on some terminals

## [0.20.2] - 2019-11-27
### Changed
- Enabling hidden value extraction now produces unusable tag files to
  discourage users from using them in cache files

- invader-build: Fixed incorrect footstep sounds being used if not using an
  MEK-extracted BSP tag

## [0.20.0] - 2019-11-26
### Added
- invader-extract: Added `--non-mp-globals` / `-n` which is required to extract
  globals tags from non-multiplayer maps, as there is little value in building
  cache files with these tags, and you will need to add the missing multiplayer
  information block, yourself

### Changed
- invader-build: Strips default data from compressed animations now

### Fixed
- invader-extract: References are cleared from scenario tags
- invader-extract: Fixed an error when extracting compressed animations
- invader-extract: Fixed sound tags' song length values not being preserved

    - `weapons\pistol\pistol.weapon`
        - Error angle set to 0.2° - 2.0° in the first trigger
        - Minimum error set to 0.0° in the first trigger
    - `weapons\plasma rifle\plasma rifle.weapon`
        - Error angle set to 0.5° - 5.0° in the first trigger
- invader-extract: Globals tags in non-multiplayer maps are no longer extracted
  unless you use `-s`, and this is due to those tags having data stripped out
- invader-extract: Tags with with `..` and `.` directories will no longer be
  extracted as these are potentially dangerous

### Deprecated
- invader-extract: Hidden values are no longer extracted by default. A compiler
  flag was added to do this, but it will be removed at a later version.

### Removed
- invader-extract: Removed -c (--continue), making it always on
- invader-extract: Removed -n (--no-external-tags), making it effectively on if
  you don't specify a maps folder

### Added
- invader-indexer: Added `--info` to invader-indexer to show information about
  Invader, similar to other Invader programs
- invader-font: Added support for .otf files
- invader-info: Added `-T stub-count`
- Added slower but lower memory functions for decompression
- invader-build: Added `--compress` which compresses the cache file using level
  19 compression; this uses `-c` which `--forge-crc` now uses `-C`

### Changed
- To prevent people from confusing arguments of different programs, two of the
  short argument letters were changed:
    - invader-bitmap: Changed `-m` to `-M` to avoid confusion with `maps`
    - invader-build: Changed `-R` to `-N` to avoid confusion with `retail`

  longer to decompress and require significantly more RAM
- invader-compress: Now exits more gracefully on failure
- invader-bitmap: Changed the default bump height to 0.026
- invader-compress: The default compression is now 19
- invader-build: The ting sound tag is now determined by the globals tag
  instead of its tag path when setting the gain based on engine version
- zstd's source code is no longer included in the repository

### Fixed
- invader-font: Fixed `-i` being used as both info and font size. It is now
  `-z` as expected.
- invader-bitmap: Fixed `-P` not working with non-.tif files
- invader-build: Fixed indexed sound tag data taking up more space than needed;
  this should result in a small file size reduction for any Halo Custom Edition

  not apply to maps built before this change.

## [0.16.0] - 2019-11-04
### Added
- New tool: invader-info - Displays an overview of a map file but can also show
  a specific value (`-T`): compressed, crc32, dirty, engine, map-type,
  scenario, scenario-path, tag-count, tags
- invader-build: Added `-R` to rename scenarios when building

### Changed
- Help menus have been rewritten for most programs
- invader-build: Shows map type when building
- invader-indexer: Changed index format to simply list tag paths with extension
- invader-build: Use new indexer - *NOTE: Previous index files no longer work*

### Removed

  `-T dirty` to indicate the map CRC32 and whether the map is dirty or not in a
  scriptable fashion.

## [0.15.2] - 2019-10-29
### Changed
- The zstd library is now static linked (except for libarchive)

### Fixed

### Added
- Added a CONTRIBUTING.md file which specifies guidelines for contributing to
  Invader
- invader-archive: Now accepts filesystem paths for the tag if `-P` is passed
- invader-bitmap: Now accepts filesystem paths for the image input if `-P` is
  passed

  passed
- invader-string: Now accepts filesystem paths for the text file if `-P` is
  passed
- invader-crc: Now prints a warning to stderr if the CRC32 in the cache file
  header is wrong
- invader-crc: Now errors with a useful error message if a resource map is
  loaded with it
- Map parser: Now errors if the internal map name overflows into the build
  string
- invader-build: Halo Demo / Trial maps can now be built (`-g demo`)
- invader-crc: Halo Demo / Trial maps can now be used
- invader-build: --no-indexed-tags was renamed to --no-external-tags
- invader-build: Building retail and demo maps now uses the resource maps
- invader-build: The gain modifier for `sound\sfx\impulse\ting\ting.sound` is
  now changed to 0.2 if building for retail or demo and 1.0 otherwise
- invader-build: Now shows the target engine of the map

### Changed
- Replaced the command line arg parser. The new one was made from scratch and
  uses only functions from the C++ standard library, allowing Invader to
  compile on more systems provided they support C++17.
- Replaced the license header in each source file with a simpler
  `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only`. For more information on this
  header, go to https://spdx.org/ids-how
- invader-archive: Now uses stat() to get the modification date of a file
- invader-bitmap: Made detail fade factor closer to tool.exe's output - still
  needs more work but it's remarkably close

### Fixed
- invader-dependency: Fixed an issue where it didn't include a null terminator,
  causing some tags to fail to open
- invader-archive: Fixed an issue where some stock HEK .gbxmodel tags tried
  (and failed) to be archived as .model tags
- invader-bitmap: Fixed an issue where sprites spanning the entire width
  wouldn't be detected
- invader-archive: Fixed an issue where the root tag would have its full system
  path included when using `-s`

## [0.13.0] - 2019-10-04
### Changed
- invader-build: Changed how stubbed tags are created so tag extractors won't
  try to extract them
- invader-bitmap: Errors if the tag contains uppercase characters in its path
- invader-build: Errors if any non-stubbed tags contain uppercase characters in
  their paths
- invader-font: Errors if the tag contains uppercase characters in its path
- invader-string: Errors if the tag contains uppercase characters in its path

### Fixed
- invader-build: Fixed not fixing the render bounding radius if it was less
  than the bounding radius but non-zero.
- invader-build: Fixed not setting the weight value for color change
  permutations in objects.
- invader-bitmap: Fixed detail fade factor so it matches tool.exe's detail fade
  factor more closely if not exactly.
- invader-build: Fixed certain sound permutation file offsets not being
  correctly marked as internal; this should fix
some sounds that sounded fine when built with tool.exe but sounded corrupt when
  built with invader-build

### Removed
- invader-bitmap: Removed --filter-blur and --filter-sharpen. Tags that have
  these values set will still have the filter(s) applied. However, for newer
  tags, you should use an image editor, as you will get similar or better
  results.
- invader-bitmap: Removed --sprite-spacing and used tool.exe's broken
  functionality, instead.
- invader-bitmap: Removed the ability to set sprite budgets below 32 or above
  512.

## [0.12.0] - 2019-09-22
### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Changed --mipmap-blur and --mipmap-sharpen to --filter-blur
  and --filter-sharpen. These now *only* affect the first bitmap even though
  image editors exist that can do these exact things. Oh well.

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed the help list line breaks

## [0.11.0] - 2019-09-22
### Added
- invader-bitmap: Added --mipmap-blur (`blur filter size`); this won't affect
  the bitmap unlike what tool.exe does (as Guerilla implies only the mipmaps
  are affected) - if you want to do this to the bitmap, itself, use an image
  editor
- invader-bitmap: Added --mipmap-sharpen (`sharpen amount`); this won't affect
  the bitmap unlike what tool.exe does (as Guerilla implies only the mipmaps
  are affected) - if you want to do this to the bitmap, itself, use an image
  editor

### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Switched to the Xbox P8 palette. This palette is probably
  worse, but the original Halo Editing Kit as well as [Mozzarilla] support it,
  so it's easier to use.
- invader-bitmap: Now stores dithering and mipmapping settings in the tag

[Mozzarilla]: https://github.com/MosesofEgypt/mozzarilla

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed blurring and sharpening values in the tag not being
  retained

### Added
- invader-bitmap: Added --usage (default, bumpmap, and detail) and
  `--bump-height` parameters

  to see if sprites will fit in a sprite
sheet
- invader-bitmap: Changed how spacing is stored in the bitmap to effectively
  match how tool.exe calculates its spacing
- invader-bitmap: Double multiply sprites now simply replaces the pixel like
  tool.exe rather than alpha blend into gray
- invader-bitmap: Usage and the p8 compression flag are now preserved
- invader-bitmap: Height maps now generate bump maps similar to tool.exe
- invader-bitmap: --detail-fade replaces --mipmap-fade and is now only usable
  on detail maps.
- invader-bitmap: --detail-fade now approximately matches how tool.exe does
  fade to gray
- invader-bitmap: Dithering is now available for 16-bit and palettized bitmaps
- invader-bitmap: Dithering now takes an argument: `<channels>`. Channels are
  letters (i.e. `argb`).

### Fixed
- invader-bitmap: Fixed some issues with spacing

### Changed
- invader-bitmap: Changed detection to first line is blue instead of first
  pixel for determining when to read a whole
image as one bitmap
